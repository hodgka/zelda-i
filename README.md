Zelda/I

A Lua script that will train a neural network the play "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time", but using an implementation of the NEAT genetic algorithm. The implementation consists of constructing population, species, organisms, genomes, neural networks, nodes, links, genes, traits, which will then be "mutated" or "evolved" and ranked according to a fitness function. 

The Neural network will only be able to play up the the point of the Deku Tree, although theoretically it could play further.
